         Write codes

                1. Write a program that prints the sum of odd numbers from 1 to N number(N = 1000_000).

                2. Write a program to print the factorial value of the given N(N = 100).
                   Please note that N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

                3.Given two numbers n = 2, m = 9. Write a program to find
                  the value of one number raised to the power of another(m֊ի n աստիճանը).
                  (Do not use Java built-in method)

                4. Given n = 1895627. Write a program that prints "The number is prime" if the given number is prime,
                   otherwise it prints "The number is not prime".
                   (Note that the number is prime if it divides on 1 and on itself)

                5. Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n = 10000.
                   1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/n

                6. Given array = {1.2,2.2,5.5,4.5,5,7.8,8.5,7,5.1,3.15}.
                   Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements.

                7. Given array = {1,25,8,6,4,5,56,55,8,68,45,62,66,82,63,33,3,7,71,32} and n = 19.
                   Write a Java program that prints the index of the n if the array contains the specific value.
                   Otherwise prints "The array does not contain the value"

                8. Given array = {25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49} and index = 4.
                   Write a Java program to remove the element with the index from an array.
                   Print the array before and after removal of the element

                9. Given array = {25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49}.
                   Write a Java program to copy the array to another array.

                10. Given array = {25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49}
                    Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of an array.

                11. Given the array = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.Write a Java program to reverse the array of int values
                    ex. {1,2,3,4,5,6} -> {6,5,4,3,2,1}

                12. Given array = {1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 2}.
                    Write program that prints duplicate values of the array.
                    So the output should be:
                              Duplicate value is: 5
                              Duplicate value is: 6

                13. Given an array of chars array = {'a','A','N','?','.','P','v','T','f','0','i','1','L','k','m','H'}.
                     Write a Java program to count the number of uppercase letters from array of chars.


                14. Given firstNum = 13, secondNum = 50. Write java program that uses while loop
                     to perform following steps:
                            1. Output all even numbers between firstNum and secindNum
                            2. Output the sum of all odd numbers between firstNum and secindNum


                15. Create a JAVA program to print the numbers that
                    divide to 3 from 10 to 100, both included, except the numbers that divide to 7.

                16. Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays (int values)
                    ex. {1,2,3,4} {3,4,5,6} -> common value 3,4

                17. Write a Java program to find the second largest and second smallest elements in an int array
                    ex. {4,5,7,8,3} -> 7is second largest element, second smallest 4


                18.  Write a Java program to compute a count of true and false elements in boolean array
                 	 ex. {true, false, false, false, true, false} -> 2 true, 4 false

                19.  Write a Java program to test the equality of two arrays
                	 ex. {1,2} {2,3,4} not equal , {1,2} {1,2} equal

                20.  Write a Java program to find a missing number in an array.
                     ex. {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} 5 is missing

                21.  Write a Java program to compute the average value of an array of integers except the largest and smallest values

                22.   Write a Java program to test if an long array contains a specific long value (use break keyword if value is found).

                23. Write program to print alphabets from a to z using while loop.

                24. Write a program that prints the count of number of digits in a number.
                    ex. 1546987 -> The number of digits is 7

                25. Write a program to check whether a number is palindrome or not.
                    Note the number is polindrome if it is the same when written forwards or backwards.
                    ex. 12321, 4554,456654 numbers are polindrome

                26. Write a program to print all Prime numbers between 1 to n(n = 1000).
