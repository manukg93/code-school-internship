    Writing:

            1. Create class with name Circle in edu.codeschool.training.classes_objects.homework4 package.
               1.1 The class should have following state and behaviour:
                      Two private instance variables(fields): radius (of the type double) and color (of the type String),
                      with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.

                      Three overloaded constructors - a default constructor with no argument,
                      a constructor which takes a double argument for radius, and a constructor which takes a double
                      argument for radius and String argument for color.

                      Three public methods: getRadius(), getArea() and getColor() which return the radius,area and color of this instance, respectively.

               1.2 Create class with name TestCircle in edu.codeschool.training.classes_objects.homework4.client package.

                     and constructor which takes length and width as parameters.

                     Following methods:
                         getLength() and getWidth() methods which return length and width respectively.

                         setLength(float length) and setWidth(float width) methods which set the length and width fields respectively
