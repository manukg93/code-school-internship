      Student, Student1 could be in another package
      All methods of MyMath should be static
      No need to call toString() method in System.out.println();
      explain isFilled()
      Cyrcle.toString() is not as required.
      Rectngle, Square are missing
      Dog.greeting() is not overridden correctly
      Shape1 area() should not be void

    MyMath does not compile
    Initialize the fields with default values John, Armenia,Yerevan respectively inside non static initialization block.


Mane Zakaryan
    The instance variables(fields) should start with lowercase
    Give the same name of constructor parameters and use this keyword
    Method names should start with lowercase
    toString() is not overriden correctly
    Class names and pacckage names are not logical
