Encapsulation is binding the data with its related functionalities.

Here functionalities mean "methods" and data means "variables"

So we keep variable and methods in one place.

That place is "class." Class is the base for encapsulation.

Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class.
It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables.


With Java Encapsulation, you can hide (restrict access)
to critical data members in your code, which improves security

Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class
as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement.

Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability
and easy to change with new requirements.

Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.
